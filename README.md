# Viso-Fox

Viso-Fox is a hypothetical ISA designed to be simple and easy to understand inspired by retro systems. It is a 64-bit addressing space where each instruction is 64 to 256 bits long, depending on the instruction type. The architecture supports a variety of instructions including arithmetic, logical, control flow, and memory operations.
